        <h2 style="text-align: center">Early Life</h2>
        Dean was born in the London Borough of Haringey to an English father and a Jamaican-Guyanese mother. Her grandmother immigrated to the UK from Guyana at age 18 as part of the Windrush generation. Her middle name "Lauryn" is inspired from Lauryn Hill, of whom her parents are big fans. She grew up in Highams Park and sometimes felt othered for being of mixed-race. Her father often listened to music and they would dance around the kitchen together. In primary school, she sang "Tomorrow" from the musical Annie in a competition and was so nervous that she initially turned her back to the audience and started crying from stage fright, although she did win second place. She took musical theatre lessons in a Saturday school and participated in a gospel choir. At age 15, she was accepted to the BRIT School and travelled a 3-hour round trip every day to attend school. At first, she studied theatre, but she switched disciplines to songwriting and convinced her mother to buy a second-hand piano.
